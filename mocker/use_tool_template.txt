        and dockerized = TRAIN[dockerized]
        and $dependency_command
        and Add conditions making sure $tool dependecies are installed
        and Add a condition checking to make sure $tool is NOT installed

            return 1

    # Configure $tool
    if TRAIN[task] is install
    or TRAIN[task] is config

    Use find_files to grep the code base for the configurations
        Configure find_files automatically
            Avoid CHANGELOG.md
            Avoid files with "deprecated"?

        How do we verify the configuration
    Use the --help / man pages to get the configurations

    # Run tool
    if TRAIN[manage_file] is not yes
    and TRAIN[task] is not run_$tool
        return 0



    # Process $tool output
